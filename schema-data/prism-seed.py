Populates the Prism database with CityPulse sample data.

Structural data (districts, assets, connections, procedures) is defined
inline. Narrative content (maintenance logs, inspection reports, findings)
is loaded from pre-generated JSON files in the data/ directory.

To generate the JSON data files, run prism-generate.py first (one time).

Usage:
    python prism-seed.py

Requires:
    - python-oracledb
    - python-dotenv
    - Pre-generated data files in data/ directory
